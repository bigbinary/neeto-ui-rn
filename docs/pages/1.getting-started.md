# Getting Started

## Installation

Open a Terminal in your project's folder and run:

```sh
yarn add @bigbinary/neetoui-rn react-native-svg react-native-webview @shopify/flash-list react-native-reanimated react-native-fast-image
```

or

```sh
npm install @bigbinary/neetoui-rn react-native-svg react-native-webview @shopify/flash-list react-native-reanimated react-native-fast-image
```

To link the library, run:

```sh
react-native link
```

or

```sh
npx react-native link
```

You need to install
[react-native-svg](https://github.com/react-native-svg/react-native-svg) because
some components rely on it.

The RichTextEditor component requires
[react-native-webview](https://github.com/react-native-webview/react-native-webview)
library to render correctly, so make sure to follow the docs while installing.

The FlashList component requires
[@shopify/flash-list](https://github.com/Shopify/flash-list) library to render
correctly, so make sure to follow the docs while installing.

## Usage with default theme.

Example:

```js
import * as React from "react";
import { theme, Container, Typography } from "@bigbinary/neetoui-rn";

export default function Main() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Container flex={1} justifyContent={"center"} alignItems={"center"}>
        <Typography>This is basic example of Typography</Typography>
      </Container>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

## Usage with custom theme.

```js
import * as React from "react";
import { theme, Typography, Container } from "@bigbinary/neetoui-rn";
import { ThemeProvider } from "styled-components";

const newTheme = {
  // copy default theme from library
  ...theme
  colors: {
    ...theme.colors,
    // customize colors
    font: {
      ...theme.colors.font,
      // customize font colors
      primary: "#9c3b3b",
    },
    background: {
      ...theme.colors.background,
      // customize background colors
      primary: "#9c3b3b",
    },
    border: {
      ...theme.colors.border,
      // customize border colors
      primary: "#9c3b3b",
    },
  },
  fonts: {
    ...theme.fonts,
    // customize fonts
  },
  fontSizes: {
    ...theme.fontSizes,
    // customize fontSizes
  },
  buttons: {
    ...theme.buttons,
    // customize button variants
  },
};

export default function Main() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={newTheme}>
      <Container flex={1} justifyContent={"center"} alignItems={"center"}>
        <Typography>This is basic example of Typography</Typography>
      </Container>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

## Usage with ParentView

`ParentView` is a top level component for every screen which uses SafeAreaView
from
[`react-native-safe-area-context`](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context)
to handle notch in iOS. Follow the instructions under `SafeAreaProvider` for the
`ParentView` component to work.

### SafeAreaProvider

You should add `SafeAreaProvider` in your app root component. Note that the
providers should not be inside a `View` that is animated with `Animated` or
inside a `ScrollView` since it can cause very frequent updates.

#### Example

```js
import { SafeAreaProvider } from "react-native-safe-area-context";

function App() {
  return <SafeAreaProvider>...</SafeAreaProvider>;
}
```
