## Getting Started

## react-native-safe-area-context

We are using SafeAreaView from
[`react-native-safe-area-context`](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context)
in our `ParentView` component to handle safe area. Follow the instructions under
`SafeAreaProvider` for the `ParentView` component to work.

### SafeAreaProvider

You should add `SafeAreaProvider` in your app root component. You may need to
add it in other places like the root of modals and routes when using
[`react-native-screens`](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens).

Note that providers should not be inside a `View` that is animated with
`Animated` or inside a `ScrollView` since it can cause very frequent updates.

#### Example

```js
import { SafeAreaProvider } from "react-native-safe-area-context";

function App() {
  return <SafeAreaProvider>...</SafeAreaProvider>;
}
```

## Development

Install all the dependencies by executing following command.

```
yarn
```

You can create new components in the `src/components` and export them from
`src/components/index.js`. You can create stories in `storybook/stories`.

You can use below commands for running storybook in different platforms:

| Platform | Command        |
| -------- | -------------- |
| Android  | `yarn android` |
| iOS:     | `yarn ios`     |
| Web      | `yarn web`     |

new commit to master. You can checkout the `publish` workflow in Github actions
to get a live update.
