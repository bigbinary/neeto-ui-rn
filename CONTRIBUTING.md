## Auto Publish to NPM

NeetoUI-RN version gets patched, auto-incremented and auto-published to npm on
new commit to master. You can checkout the `publish` workflow in git actions to
get a live update.

Don't push build folder manually, Github workflow automatically builds project
and pushes build folder to master on new commit to master.
